# Changelog

All notable changes to Archaeopteryx.js. This file accumulates entries as work
lands on `master`; a release collects the `Unreleased` section into its GitHub
Release body. The published npm package and the live demo site are decoupled —
`docs/` is served from `master`, so demos update on every push, while npm
consumers only see a change when a version is cut.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Trees with branch lengths no longer open as cladograms.** The
  phylogram-vs-cladogram default counted every branch uniformly, so an
  exporter that omits `branch_length` on tips where it would be zero could
  drag a fully measured tree under the threshold. A 9256-tip BV-BRC influenza
  phyloXML with **all 5265 of its internal branches measured** opened as a
  cladogram on a ratio of 0.40. The default now judges the branches that
  actually carry the scale — internal, non-root — and treats an explicit
  zero-length branch as measured rather than missing. A missing tip length
  still draws correctly (the tip sits at its parent); a missing internal length
  is what destroys the scale. Trees with no internal branches (star trees) are
  judged on their tips. All 18 demo trees are unaffected.

### Unreleased since 3.0.0 (already on master)

- `open.html`: visualize your own tree entirely in the browser, plus an Expert
  options panel exercising every launch config key.
- The floating toolbar card is draggable on `demo.html` and `open.html`.
- `parseTree` recognizes phyloXML by content, not just by filename extension.
- Removed the dormant "Submit Selected" button; node selection is pull-only.
